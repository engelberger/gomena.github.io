### Notes
Some notes I have written over the years. They don't have enough stuff to qualify as a paper, but happy if someone can find some utility in them.

* [**On the summability of the weights for completely random measures**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/SumPoissonProcess.pdf)
The result of a discussion during an insightful class by Professor [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/)

* [**On the relation between matching by propensity score and weighted least squares estimator for the average treatment effect**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/Comment_WLS_ATE.pdf)
Result of a discussion in the Machine Learning Reading group led by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/)

* [**Qualyfing exam cheatsheet**](http://stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/cheatsheet.pdf)


### Gifs
I like the idea of turning mathematical/computational concepts into gifs. Sometimes they can be really cool. Here some examples

* [**Mandelbrot sets**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/fractals1/)

* [**Artificial snowflakes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/snowflakes/)

* [**Phosphene and mandala**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/phosphene/)

* [**Gaussian Densities**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/tiling/)

* [**The creation of Adam and God Ex Nihilo**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/exnihilo/)

* [**Gaussian Processes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/gp/)

* [**Cosmic Rays**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/cosmic/)

* [**Neural Spikes**]({{baseurl}}/gifs/spikes/)
