I'm a final year PhD student in the [Statistics Department, Columbia University](stat.columbia.edu).  **I am in an active search of research positions, both in the industry and academia**.
<br />
<br />
My advisor is [Liam Paninski](http://stat.columbia.edu/~liam), with whom I collaborate closely.
<br />
<br />
During my PhD I have teamed with top-tier research groups. Indeed, a big part of my dissertation is a collaboration with [EJ Chichilnisky's Lab](http://med.stanford.edu/neurosurgery/research/chichilnisky.html) at [Stanford University](www.stanford.edu), where I've developed ML-based algorithms to support large-scale closed-loop control of neural activity in the retina based on electrical stimulation. Scientifically, this emerging technology has the potential to improve our understanding of neural circuits, even beyond the retina. Also, clinically, it might be useful to enhance the resolution of future retinal prosthesis, hence, providing a better treatment for people with degenerative eye disease (retinitis pigmentosa). The code I developed ([**see the current pre-print in review**](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/27/089912) and [**see the open-source version of the code** here]([open-source Code](https://github.com/gomena/spike_separation_artifacts) ) is already being used to analyze huge volumes of neural data.
<br />
<br />
More recently, I was hosted by Jasper Snoek for a summer internship at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/), where I conducted fundamental original research on Artificial Intelligence, coming up with a new Neural Network that is particularly useful for solving the combinatorial problem of a matching. We call this a *Sinkhorn Network*. [**Code, open sourced by Google, is already available here**](https://github.com/google/gumbel_sinkhorn/). Papers will be published soon to the ArXiv, stay tuned!
<br />
<br />
Thanks to my PhD path I have developed strong quantitative and computational proficiency: I've been exposed to problems that involve the extraction of meaningful information in massive (neural) datasets with non-trivial structure, and plagued with corruption. I've incorporated Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/DL/AI) as the right semantics for problem modeling and solving, in our days. I've showed that I am quickly able identify the relevant structures of scientific problems, and to appropriately reduce them to some ML/DL/AI model.
<br />
<br />
Please reach out to me if you think I could be a good fit on a research role in your team. Upon graduation, I am particularly interested in doing research that involves using or creating ML/DL/AI methods for their application in scientific problems, particularly in life sciences and/or medicine/healthcare. In a related direction, I am interested in investigating new ways to draw causal relationships from huge datasets, and if necessary, in the design of optimal experiments (interventions) for determining such relations.
