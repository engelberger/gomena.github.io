I am a [Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, working in the lab of [Pierre Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/?pli=1&authuser=1). Previously, I did my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/), where I developed algorithms for extracting neural signals from recordings.

The picture above is from my hometown: Santiago, Chile. There I obtained by B.S. in [Mathematical Engineering](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/) at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl).


### Interests

I am interested bridging theoretical and practical aspects of statistics through the development of scalable and robust methods and algorithms for making sense of the large volumes of data that are routinely collected with modern technologies in the life sciences. Currently, my work gravitates mostly at the interface between statistics, optimal transport and machine learning: I am developing theoretical results in optimal transport to better understand its pratical success, and I am also developing new algorithms and methods, notably, for the inference of neural identity in C.elegans.
