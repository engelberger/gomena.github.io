I am a [Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, working in the lab of [Pierre Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/?pli=1&authuser=1). Previously, I did my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/). During my PhD days I was fortunate to be an intern at Google Brain, where I was hosted by Jasper Snoek. 

The picture above is from my hometown: Santiago, Chile. There I obtained by B.S. in [Mathematical Engineering](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/) at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl).


### Interests

I am a computational statistician who is interested in developing scalable, robust and interpretable methods and algorithms for making sense of the large volumes of data that are routinely collected with modern technologies. Some questions I am interested in currently are (the list is not exhaustive): what makes popular algorithms work well in certain regimes (e.g. dimension) but not others, what makes models robust and how can we desing robust algorithmsI do enjoy working with real data: in my PhD I developed algorithms for extracting neural signals from recordings, and I am looking forward to explore new collaborations involving data: every time traditional approaches fail is an opportunity to create a new method.



### News
* Sept 01th, 2019. Started postdoc!

* Feb 14th, 2018. I gave the talk [*Statistical Machine Learning Methods for
                                   Large-scale Neural Data Analysis*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/talks/MLNeuroscience.pdf) at the **Vector Institute**, Toronto.

* Jan 29th, 2018. Our paper [*Learning latent permutations with Gumbel-Sinkhorn networks* 
                             ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08665) (joint with D. Belanger, S. Linderman and J. Snoek) was accepted to *ICLR 2018*.

* Jan 22nd, 2018. I gave the talk [*Optimal Transport and applications to Data Science*](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/talks/OTTalk.pdf) at the Center for Mathematical Modeling, Universidad de Chile.
                                                                                       
* Dec 22nd, 2017. Our paper [Reparameterizing the Birkhoff Polytope for Variational Permutation Inference
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09508) (joint with S. Linderman, H. Cooper, J. Cunningham and L. Paninski) was accepted to **AISTATS, 2018**. Nos vemos en Lanzarote!

* Dec 1st, 2017. I will be presenting two workshop papers at **NIPS**: [Our work on Sinkhorn Networks](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/SinkhornOT.pdf) will be presented in the [Optimal Transport & Machine Learning Workshop](http://otml17.marcocuturi.net/). Also, [our work on permutation inference for C. elegans data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gonzalo/pubs/PermutationWorms.pdf) will be presented in the [Worms Information Processing Workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/wwnip2017/).

* Nov 13rd, 2017. Our methods paper *Electrical stimulus artifact cancellation and neural spike detection on large multi-electrode arrays* is  now [in press at **PLOS Computational Biology**](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005842). We think this is a significant step towards enabling closed-loop experiments featuring high-resolution neural electrical stimulation.
