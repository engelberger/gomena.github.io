I am a [Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, working in the lab of [Pierre Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/?pli=1&authuser=1). Previously, I did my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/), where I developed algorithms for extracting neural signals from recordings.

The picture above is from my hometown: Santiago, Chile. There I obtained by B.S. in [Mathematical Engineering](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/) at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl).


### Interests

I am interested in bridging the theory and practice of statistics through the development of scalable and robust methods for making sense of the large volumes of data that are routinely collected with modern technologies in the life sciences. Currently, my work gravitates at the intersection of statistics, optimal transport and machine learning: I am studying statistical aspects of optimal transport, both at the theoretical and methodological level. Additionally, and based on this, I am developing new algorithms, notably, to identify neurons in the worm C.elegans.
