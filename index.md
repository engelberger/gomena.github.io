I am a [Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University, working in the lab of [Pierre Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/?pli=1&authuser=1). Previously, I did my PhD in Statistics at Columbia University with [Liam Paninski](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~liam/), where I developed algorithms for extracting neural signals from recordings.

The picture above is from my hometown: Santiago, Chile. There I obtained by B.S. in [Mathematical Engineering](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/) at [Universidad de Chile](http://www.uchile.cl).


### Research

I develop scalable and robust methods for understanding the large volumes of data that are routinely collected with modern technologies in the life sciences. Currently, my research intersects statistics, optimal transport and machine learning: I study statistical aspects of optimal transport, both at the theoretical and methodological level. Additionally, and based on this, I develop new algorithms, for example, to identify neurons in the worm C.elegans.
